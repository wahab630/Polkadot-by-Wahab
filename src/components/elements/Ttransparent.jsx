            Transparent on-chain governance
            </h1>
            <p>
            Updates to the protocol happen fork-free via transparent on-chain voting, so protocol development never stalls due to the lack of a clear process. The relay chain uses a sophisticated governance mechanism that is designed to establish a transparent, accountable and binding process for resolving disputes and upgrading the network.
            </p>
            <p>DOT tokens are used to participate in governance decisions, including tabling proposals, voting, and bonding.</p>
            <p>Parachains are free to design their own governance mechanisms, allowing for maximum freedom without affecting other parachains.</p>
